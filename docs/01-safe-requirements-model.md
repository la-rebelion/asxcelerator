# SAFe Requirements Model

The SAFe Requirements Model is a hierarchical model that defines requirements at the Epic, Feature, and Story levels. It is based on the [INVEST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INVEST_(mnemonic)) model for writing good user stories. The SAFe Requirements Model is a living document that will be updated as the product evolves and new requirements are identified.

## Our Class Diagram Implementation

Taking the SAFe Requirements Model as a reference, we have implemented the following Class Diagram, and is the one used to generate the `frontMatter.taxonomy.contentTypes` json.

Feel free to modify it to fit your needs, to suggest improvements, or sharing your ideas in the [Discussions](giscussions) section, or reporting an [Issue](issues). Togheter we can improve this project! ðŸš€

Generate the `frontMatter.taxonomy.contentTypes` json based on previous Class Diagram, following example below:

```json
"frontMatter.taxonomy.contentTypes": [
  {
    "name": "Epic",
    "previewPath": null,
    "pageBundle": false,
    "fields": [
      {
        "title": "Title",
        "name": "title",
        "type": "string"
      },
      {
        "title": "Description",
        "name": "description",
        "type": "string"
      },
      {
        "title": "Publishing date",

Association -->  
In an association relationship, one or more objects can be associated with each other.  
Objects are linked with each other.

o--	Aggregation  
In an aggregation relationship, objects that are associated with each other can remain in the scope of a system without each other.  
Linked objects are not dependent upon the other object.

*--	Composition  
In a composition relationship, objects that are associated with each other cannot remain in the scope without each other.  
Objects are highly dependent upon each other.
