        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the fast-evolving landscape of cloud, IT, software engineering, and web development, innovation isn't just a buzzword—it's a way of life. As a systems architect, innovator, and solopreneur with a penchant for pushing the boundaries of what's possible, I've always believed in the power of learning and experimenting with state-of-the-art technologies. Today, I'm thrilled to unveil a new chapter in this journey—a project that embodies both my passion for innovation and my drive to transform the world of agile development.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="introducing-asxcelerator-a-pathway-to-unleash-agility">Introducing ASXcelerator: A Pathway to Unleash Agility<a href="#introducing-asxcelerator-a-pathway-to-unleash-agility" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Introducing ASXcelerator: A Pathway to Unleash Agility" title="Direct link to Introducing ASXcelerator: A Pathway to Unleash Agility">​</a></h2><p>Enter <strong>ASXcelerator</strong>, an ingenious tool that promises to redefine the way solopreneurs, startups, and enterprises approach the scaling of agile development. For those of you not familiar, ASXcelerator isn't just another tool in the toolbox. It's the bicycle with training wheels that ushers you into the realm of Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) with unparalleled ease. But why, you ask, is this tool a game-changer? Let's dive into the details.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-hypothesis-innovating-with-markdown-docusaurus-and-github">The Hypothesis: Innovating with Markdown, Docusaurus, and GitHub<a href="#the-hypothesis-innovating-with-markdown-docusaurus-and-github" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Hypothesis: Innovating with Markdown, Docusaurus, and GitHub" title="Direct link to The Hypothesis: Innovating with Markdown, Docusaurus, and GitHub">​</a></h2><p>As an advocate of innovation, I've concocted an exciting hypothesis. What if we could revolutionize the way we approach SAFe artifacts—epics, features, stories, and beyond—using the trifecta of Markdown, Docusaurus, and GitHub? Markdown, known for its simplicity, has the potential to democratize the creation and understanding of these artifacts. Docusaurus, the platform for building, deploying, and maintaining documentation websites, offers the infrastructure for hosting this transformative content. And GitHub, a hub of collaboration, becomes the source of truth that unites a community around these agile artifacts.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="using-this-trifecta-we-can">Using this trifecta, we can:<a href="#using-this-trifecta-we-can" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Using this trifecta, we can:" title="Direct link to Using this trifecta, we can:">​</a></h3><ul class="contains-task-list containsTaskList_mC6p"><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> <!-- -->Leverage VSCode as the IDE for creating SAFe artifacts! 🤯</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> <!-- -->Create SAFe artifacts using Markdown templates with <a href="https://frontmatter.codes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Front Matter</a></li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> <!-- -->Use GitHub as the source of truth for SAFe artifacts! 😺</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> <!-- -->Use Docusaurus as the platform for hosting SAFe artifacts! 🤩</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> <!-- -->Use Markdown as the language for crafting SAFe artifacts! 🤓</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> <a href="https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/plugins/@docusaurus/plugin-pwa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Docusaurus plug-in</a> <a href="https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Progressive Web App</a> (PWA) for offline access to SAFe artifacts! 📱</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> <!-- -->React to changes in SAFe artifacts using GitHub <a href="https://github.com/features/actions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Actions</a>! 🤖</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> <!-- -->Accelerate the creation of SAFe artifacts with <a href="https://github.com/features/copilot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Copilot</a>! 🤖</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> <!-- -->Code from anywhere using GitHub <a href="https://github.com/features/codespaces" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Codespaces</a>! 👨🏽‍💻</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> <!-- -->Collaboration with community members using GitHub <a href="https://github.com/features/discussions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discussions</a> and giscussions! 💬</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> <!-- -->Generate the Acceptance Criteria for SAFe artifacts with Markdown and Concordion! 🧪</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> <!-- -->Behavioral-Driven Development (BDD) with Markdown and <a href="https://concordion.org/discussing/java/markdown/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Concordion</a>! 👩🏽‍💼</li></ul><p><strong>Sky's the limit!</strong> 🚀</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="future-roadmap-if-hypothesys-is-proven">Future roadmap if hypothesys is proven<a href="#future-roadmap-if-hypothesys-is-proven" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Future roadmap if hypothesys is proven" title="Direct link to Future roadmap if hypothesys is proven">​</a></h3><ul><li>Headless CMS integration! 🧑🏾‍🚀<ul class="contains-task-list containsTaskList_mC6p"><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> <!-- -->Strapi</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> <!-- -->Contentful</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> <!-- -->Directus</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> <!-- -->Sanity</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> <!-- -->GraphCMS</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> <!-- -->DatoCMS</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> <!-- -->Cockpit</li></ul></li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-dogfooding-experiment-asxcelerator-as-a-playground">The "Dogfooding" Experiment: ASXcelerator as a Playground<a href="#the-dogfooding-experiment-asxcelerator-as-a-playground" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The &quot;Dogfooding&quot; Experiment: ASXcelerator as a Playground" title="Direct link to The &quot;Dogfooding&quot; Experiment: ASXcelerator as a Playground">​</a></h2><p>To put this hypothesis to the test, I'm embarking on a fascinating journey—an experiment in <em>dogfooding</em>. In other words, I'm using ASXcelerator as my own playground to bring this hypothesis to life. By creating, validating, and iterating SAFe artifacts using Markdown, Docusaurus, and GitHub, I'm walking the talk. But I'm not doing this alone; <strong>I invite you, the reader, to join me on this transformative expedition.</strong><br>
<a href="https://go.rebelion.la/asx-beta-subs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Register to the waiting list</a> to be notified when the experiment starts, of course, you can clone the repo and start playing with it right now! 🤓</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="your-feedback-a-crucial-building-block">Your Feedback: A Crucial Building Block<a href="#your-feedback-a-crucial-building-block" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Your Feedback: A Crucial Building Block" title="Direct link to Your Feedback: A Crucial Building Block">​</a></h2><p>As a solopreneur and an advocate for innovation, I understand the value of diverse perspectives.
